dotvim
======

My vim files.  There be Ents here, so don't be hasty.

NOTE: I _do not_ recommend using these out of the box.  These are _my_ personal
settings, and some of the options I set may do some unexpected things for you.

# Neovim

These config files should work with neovim as well, you just need to link the
vim config directory to the nvim config directory.

    ln -s ~/.vim $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim
