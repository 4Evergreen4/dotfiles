* [ ] Do vim croquet: http://www.drbunsen.org/vim-croquet/
* [ ] Stop zsh completion when a character is typed.  (or figure out how to get auto-fu to only trigger when tab is pressed)
* [ ] Figure out what is making pandoc highlighting so slow
* [ ] Make install scripts for everything (preferably in a language that is not `sh`)
* [ ] Make a script for easy changing of terminal color schemes
* [ ] Make a personal `spellfile` (and set up vim spell checking)
