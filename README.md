Evergreen's dotfiles
====================

These are my configuration files.  As with most dotfiles repositories I would
not recommend using all of these configuration files as is, but hopefully you
will at least find snippets of them to be useful :-)


# Installation

I have been meaning to make an installation script for a long time but have not
gotten around to it. For now just follow the documentation for each specific
program to figure out where to symlink things to.
