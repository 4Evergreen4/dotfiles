My Essential Software
=====================

This is a list of software that I find myself using very regularly.

# Command Line

- tmux: My choice of terminal multiplexer.
- zsh: My favorite shell currently
- **[LINUX]** kitty: The best terminal emulator around.  Konsole is good too if
  you are using KDE.

# Web

- Firefox: My web browser of choice
- Thunderbird: My email client of choice.
- Bittorrent Client _(Transmission, qBittorrent, KTorrent, etc)_
- Wireguard: Good simple VPN

# Dev

- python 3.4+: I do a lot of stuff with python, so it is essential.
- pip: Much better python package management than easy_install, also essential.
- ipython: The best interactive python interpreter, no question.
- virtualenv: essential for python development.
- poetry: Not as essential, but useful for managing virtualenvs in a cross-platform manner
- pylama: general purpose python code linter.  It is a wrapper around pycodestyle
  _(previously pep8)_, pydocstyle _(previously pep257)_ and pyflakes.
- pylint: Very picky python linter; useful for catching code smells but take it with
  a grain of salt
- pyls: python language server
- vim: The best text and code editor. Come at me emacs! _(preferrably compiled
  with `--with-features=huge` and python support)_.  Or just use neovim.
- git: The version control system I am most familiar with.
- C/C++ compiler _(gcc, clang)_: For C hacking.
- ccls: c language server
- bear: generates command list for ccls
- CMake: A really popular alternative to configure scripts.
- meson: Much better than CMake (though it is a low bar to clear tbf).
- **[WINDOWS]** msys2 _(or Git for Windows SDK)_: Linux on windows.  _(better
  than cygwin)_
- Exuberant ctags: Necessary for some vim plugins
- ag or "the silver searcher": Used by FZF to get gitignore-sensitive results
- ripgrep: better than ag for command line use
- fd: better `find`
- exa: better `ls`
- keychain: SSH agent handler
- shellcheck: shell script linter

# School/Office

- Libreoffice: Great office suite that can handle most document formats
- Geogebra: Wonderful tool for exploring geometry and algebra
- Speedcrunch: Nice simple calculator
- **[LINUX]** Atril PDF Viewer: The best light-weight pdf viewer for gnome that I could find,
  though evince is okay. I would use okular on KDE.
- **[WINDOWS]** Sumatra PDF: Another PDF viewer.  It is the only good open source viewer
  I could find for windows, though it is kind of ugly.
- Pandoc: An awesome document converter.

# Multimedia

- Audacity: Best audio editor out there.
- Spotiy: My favorite music streaming service, though the client is a bit heavy
- spotifyd/spotify-tui: Light weight daemon/TUI for spotify that works nicely on laptops
- Audacious: My music player of choice.
- **[LINUX]** simplescreenrecorder: The only option (IMO) for screen recording.  It just
  blows everything else out of the water (minus OBS)
- OBS: Just a great all-around streaming/recording tool
- VLC: My favorite video player, supports every audio/video format under the sun
- GIMP: A really nice advanced image editing tool.
- Inkscape: Vector graphics editor.
- **[WINDOWS]** Greenshot: The best screenshot utility I could find for windows.
- Bitwig: best DAW on linux

- Quassel

# System

- **[LINUX]** Baobab or FileLight: Nice disk usage visualization.
- **[LINUX]** GParted or KPartition: Graphical partition editor.

- rsync: Simple file synchronization.
- restic: Good good backups
- b2: Utility for configuring the location of the aforementioned good good backups
- Nextcloud: Self-hosted dropbox
- **[WINDOWS]** AutoHotkey: Awesome key remapping software.  _(also a
  programming language)_
- **[WINDOWS]** AHK Studio: Nice AutoHotkey script editor written in AutoHotkey.
- PuTTY: SSH/Telnet client and terminal emulator, plus much more.
- **[WINDOWS]** WinSCP: Great FTP client that doesn't bundle adware in its installer
