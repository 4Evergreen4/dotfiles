My Essential Software
=====================

This is a list of software that I find myself using very regularly.

# Command Line

- tmux: My choice of terminal multiplexer.
- bash: The shell I know the most about.
- **[LINUX]** URxvt: The best terminal emulator around.

# Web

- Firefox: My web browser of choice
- Dropbox: An embarassingly essential piece of software for me.
- Thunderbird: My email client of choice.
- Bittorrent Client _(Transmission, qBittorrent, KTorrent, etc)_

# Dev

- python 2.7+ and 3.4+: I do a lot of stuff with python, so it is essential.
- pip: Much better python package management than easy_install, also essential.
- ipython: The best interactive python interpreter, no question.
- virtualenv: essential for python development.
- pylama: general purpose python code linter.  It is a wrapper around pycodestyle
  _(previously pep8)_, pydocstyle _(previously pep257)_ and pyflakes.
- vim: The best text and code editor. Come at me emacs! _(preferrably compiled
  with `--with-features=huge` and python support)_
- git: The version control system I am most familiar with.
- C/C++ compiler _(gcc)_: For C hacking.
- CMake: A really popular alternative to configure scripts.
- **[WINDOWS]** msys2 _(or Git for Windows SDK)_: Linux on windows.  _(better
  than cygwin)_
- Haskell Platform: A necessity for haskell development.

# School/Office

- Libreoffice: Great office suite that can handle most document formats
- Geogebra: Awesome tool for exploring geometry and algebra
- Speedcrunch: Nice simple calculator
- **[LINUX]** Atril PDF Viewer: The best light-weight pdf viewer for gnome that I could find,
  though evince is okay. I would use okular on KDE.
- Sumatra PDF: Another PDF viewer.  It is the only good open source viwewer
  I could find for windows _(and linux)_, though it is kind of ugly.
- Epson escpr: Printer driver.  'Nuff said.
- Pandoc: An awesome document converter.

# Multimedia

- Audacity: Best audio editor out there.
- Clementine: My music player of choice.

  blows everything else out of the water

  programming language)_
