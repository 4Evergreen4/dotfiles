xboxdrv
=======

These are my xboxdrv configs for various games.  These are my personal
preferences so you will probably want to tweak these to your own liking if you
decide to use them.  To use a config, do `xboxdrv -c {config_name}.ini`

# Installation
You can link this directory to ~/.xboxdrv to make loading of configs more
convenient.
